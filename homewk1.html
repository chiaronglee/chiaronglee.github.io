        <p>I have a Computer Science background and I used to work for 
            Semiconductor company, but I am transitioning to the world of Web
            Development. So I want to get a certificate of Web/Mobile 
            Application Development, and it is a requirement for me to complete 
            this class.

            <p> This publisher is offering <strong>Web development books, Programming language books and
                Database/SQL books.</strong> If you are new to Web design or an old pro, these books are 
                must-have in my opinion. I love how it starts out with the basics and then moves
                on to the good stuff. Each chapter is full of examples and sample code showing you 
                how to do the most common techniques that you will face as a web developer/designer.
