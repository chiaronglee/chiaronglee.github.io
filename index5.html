    <h2>Comparison - React Native vs. PhoneGap vs. Flutter</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li class="order_list"> Rich pre-styled component library</li>
        <ul>
        <li>React Native component libraries could save you a lot of 
            time with several ready built-in components. Developers 
            need to style the components to match according to the 
            platform guidelines. In simple words, developers need to 
            adjust the coding to make React Native components adaptive 
            to the platform.
        </li>
        <li>The arrival of hybrid cross-platform frameworks drags the 
            native PhoneGap framework as an under-performing tool. In recent,
            PhoneGap alerts its tools suitable for developing a Cross-platform 
            mobile app.
        </li>
        <li>Flutter is almost similar to the React Native; the components of 
            flutter support iOS platform if you prefer to use them on other 
            platforms, then you need to do some alternations.
        </li> 
        </ul><br>
        <li class="order_list">Performance</li>
        <ul>
        <li>React Native specifically created to provide higher performance 
            owing to that React Native can’t be used for developing apps that 
            can be used across two platforms.
        </li>
        <li>PhoneGap uses Cordova for running JavaScript owing to that it offers 
            medium performance.
        </li>
        <li>Flutter manages to provide superior performance by skipping interactive
            bridges with native components.
        </li><br>
        </ul>
        <li class="order_list">User interface </li>
        <ul>
            <li>React Native utilizes ReactJS that plays a huge role in User Interface. 
                Because of ReactJS library React Native offers amazing UI almost similar 
                to the native apps.
            </li>
            <li>PhoneGap manages to improve its UI libraries by using those components, 
                developers c>an create web pages and mobile apps with better UI for the 
                target audience.
            </li>
            <li>Flutter manages to beat other app development tool and provider best UI 
                for the apps developed under its framework.
            </li>
        </ul><br>
        <li class="order_list">Community </li>
        <ul>
            <li>React Native is a robust platform and so popular in today’s market. Owing 
                to that developer gets community recognition easily and quickly.
            </li>
            <li>PhoneGap has strong community support since it currently been undertaken by 
                the Adobe System.
            </li>
            <li>Flutter tool is completely new to the market, and the maker’s Google is working
                hard to popularize it as a significant tool in the mobile app development world.
            </li>
        </ul><br>
        <li class="order_list">Platform Architecture</li>    
        <ul>
            <li>React Native framework utilizes JavaScript & React to developing Cross-platform
                mobile apps. Developers can use it for developing an app for Android, iOS, and UWP.
            </li>
            <li>PhoneGap framework utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing Cross-platform 
                mobile apps. Developers can use it for developing apps for all popular mobile OS 
                platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, and so.
            </li>
            <li>Flutter framework utilizes Dart Language for developing Cross-platform mobile apps. 
                Developers can use it for developing an app for Android, iOS, and Google Fuchsia.
            </li>
        </ul>
